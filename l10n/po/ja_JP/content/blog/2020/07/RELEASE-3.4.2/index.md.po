"The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in [this Github issue](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/3244).\n"
"Although we already have a fix for this problem (see [CAMEL-15309](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-15309)), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems. We plan to continue compiling with Java 8 until we eventually make Java 11 the base version for Camel.\n"

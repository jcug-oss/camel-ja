" 1. Getting started\n"
"   * Study the current website and the technology stack involved. By the end of this, you will be able to articulate how the website is built, where each aspect of the website is defined and how to go about implementing changes. A good outcome of this would be writing the website contribution guide with the acquired knowledge.\n"
"   * Research similar websites for inspiration. By the end of this, you will be able to showcase similar websites, discuss the pros and cons of their approaches and contrast that with the current website. A good outcome of this would be a document showcasing that.\n"
" 1. Work on information architecture. The result will be a visual map of the website showcasing the organization of the website.\n"
" 1. Work on the website design proposal. The end result will be mockups of the design.\n"

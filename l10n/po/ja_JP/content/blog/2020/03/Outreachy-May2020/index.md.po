Some examples include the ever-expanding top navigation menu, low color contrast, small touch targets for menus in mobile version, poor content organization (especially in the user manual) and the improvements to search. With that we identified four main focus areas: more modern design, usability, content organization and improvement, and improving the search.\n"

"As already said, our plan is to deprecate the original AWS components, but we'll do this only after the community will confirm the features parity and we'll have enough feedback. So, please, test them and report bugs, improvements and whatever you've in mind while using them.\n"
"We are working on more components to add for AWS2 components family, like Athena, RDS, DocumentDB and more. At the same time, we'd like to improve the existing AWS2 components, by supporting the new features coming in the new SDK, like the non-blocking I/O and the ability to plug in a different HTTP implementation at run time (actually we are using only the Apache-client one).\n"
"So there is still a lot of work to do and this is a good area for getting started and starting your contributions history to Apache Camel. We're waiting for you!\n"

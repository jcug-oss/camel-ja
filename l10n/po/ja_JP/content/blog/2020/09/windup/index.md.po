In order to ease the upgrade, [Matej](https://github.com/mmelko) and I have decided to leverage the open source application migration tool [Windup](https://github.com/windup/windup) and extend it's existing migration [rules](https://github.com/windup/windup-rulesets) by adding Camel 2.x --> Camel 3 [rules](https://github.com/windup/windup-rulesets/tree/master/rules-reviewed/camel3/camel2).\n"

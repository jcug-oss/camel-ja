"Quarkus dev mode (a.k.a. `mvn quarkus:dev`) exists since the very beginnings of Quarkus.\n"
"It not only starts your application so that you can test it manually,\n"
"but it also keeps watching for changes in your workspace, recompiling the modified classes as needed\n"
"and reloading the running application.\n"
"Now with continuous testing, your tests are executed as you change your application code.\n"
"You have to press `r` to enable it.\n"
"You may want to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyiTzbezjw) to learn more about the new continuous testing feature.\n"

The new **OpenShift 4.7 developer console** is a clear evidence of this pattern. You can look at what it provides in the following animation:\n"

"From the console, the user can add a new \"Event Source\" and the UI displays a collection of possibilities: well, starting from Camel K 1.4.0, that collection of sources will display **the official Apache Camel Kamelet catalog**. This means that contributing new Kamelets to the catalog will allow you to enhance the OpenShift catalog of Knative sources, for instance.\n"

msgid "But there's nothing in the Kamelet catalog specifically related to OpenShift: **we show this to encourage people to take the same approach** for other platforms (in-house or open source, especially Kubernetes-based) and use cases. One of the advantages of this approach is that, since Kamelets provide a [well defined JSON-schema interface](/camel-k/latest/kamelets/kamelets.html) for their configuration, they can be made available for any kind of users, including those who don't even know anything about Apache Camel.\n"

msgid "Leaving the Kubernetes world, you can also imagine how the Kamelet Catalog can improve the user experience in Camel Kafka Connectors. As of today, A Camel Kafka connector can be created from a single Camel component: this is a quite powerful model, since components have a high degree of configurability, but it has severe limitations because complex use cases cannot be fullfilled by configuring a single Camel component. The Kamelet model will add to Camel Kafka Connector users to develop more complex use cases (because a Kamelet is a route template that can use multiple components and enterprise integration patterns) and share their connectors with other users via the Kamelet catalog.\n"

"From a pure user perspective, the main difference between them is that the Camel component is a highly configurable resource that is intended to be used in \n"
"a Camel development environment. Components contain lots of properties that allow to customize every aspect of their behavior and how they interact with the Camel context, the registry and so on. Additionally, a single Camel component can serve multiple purposes: e.g. the `camel-facebook` component allows receiving any kind of event or execute any action on Facebook; the `camel-http` component allows to contact any external `http` or `https` endpoint.\n"

"By contrast, Kamelets are tailored around actual use cases. A `todo-sink` Kamelet may be created in the catalog to transform an event into an entry of a \"To-Do Application\" (I refer here to that kind of applications where you add the things you need to, and later mark them as resolved). It may use the `camel-http` component under the hood, but that will be an implementation detail. The `todo-sink` Kamelet will also expose to the end user not the full list of parameters available in the `camel-http` component, but a reduced set of configuration properties that are relevant for the business purpose (i.e. adding an entry into a \"To-Do Application\").\n"
"Similarly, when the Kamelet model will evolve with the help of the community, there won't be a single `facebook-source` Kamelet, but there will be probably many facebook-related sources, one for each use case that the community finds relevant.\n"

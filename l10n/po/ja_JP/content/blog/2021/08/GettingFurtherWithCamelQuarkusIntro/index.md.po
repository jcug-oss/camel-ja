"The idea is really to implement a typical Camel route on a local machine. Beyond that, this will be a good occasion to show the great integration of some Quarkus features into Camel. There will also be a few tips specific to Camel Quarkus to review, such as the\n"
"right way to tune a Camel component with Java code. Last but not least, we'll dig deeper and deeper into the native mode theory...\n"
"but also practice ! Indeed, we'll even experience some concrete problems and discover the corresponding answers.\n"

This situation will be an opportunity to touch the trade-off between the time to serve the first request and the memory usage.\n"

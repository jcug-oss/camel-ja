msgid "Before showing what it can do, it's important to give a brief overview of what JBang is. According to their website, JBang lets us \" â€¦ create, edit and run self-contained source-only Java programs with unprecedented ease\". In practice, this means that it lets us run Java applications without the need to write an application, going through the usual build/compile/deploy cycle. It turns Java into a scripting language, in a similar fashion to Python, Shell Script and others. With easy access to the dependency management, configuration, debugging and other features, it makes it very easy for Java developers to use all the power that Java and its ecosystem of components can offer.\n"

We have a couple of [examples](https://github.com/apache/camel/tree/b0bada2f41029cd8496db4defc09b3a48b403ad4/dsl/camel-jbang/camel-jbang-main/examples) in the code base, so let's look at one that produces messages at a periodic interval and publishes them on a JMS broker using the AMQP 1.0 protocol:\n"

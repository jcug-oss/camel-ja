However, if you are using some of the more advanced features and other plugins in Camel then migration is needed. Also, custom components must be migrated and recompiled. There are other adjustments such as Spring Boot users must use `org.apache.camel.springboot` as groupId instead of `org.apache.camel` etc. All details can be seen in the [migration guide](/manual/latest/camel-3-migration-guide.html).\n"

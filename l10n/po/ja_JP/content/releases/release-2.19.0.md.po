"* Introduced\n"
"Camel Connector's which is a simplified version of a Camel component that has\n"
"been pre-configured for a specific use-case.\n"
"* Upgraded to Spring Boot 1.5.x.\n"
"* The Camel Maven Plugin now provides the\n"
"`camel:validate` goal to parse your Java and XML source code for any\n"
"Camel routes and report invalid Camel endpoint uri and simple expression\n"
"errors. You can run this at code time (not runtime). \n"
"* Camel `Main` and Spring Boot\n"
"and Camel Maven Plugin can now auto\n"
"terminate the JVM after Camel has been running for maximum duration of\n"
"seconds, processed messages or been idle for a period.\n"
"* Camel source code can build with Java 9 in preparation for official\n"
"support for Java 9 in a future release\n"
"* All the Camel Spring Boot starter components now has more of the\n"
"components default values included in their metadata which allows\n"
"tooling to display such information\n"
"* Deprecated more components and camel-core APIs that will be dropped in\n"
"Camel 3.0 or sometime in the future\n"
"* Introduced `ReloadStrategy` as SPI which allows custom providers to\n"
"implement logic for triggering live reloads of Camel routes.\n"
"* The Camel Maven Plugin now allows to\n"
"live reload route changes from XML files when running Camel. This can\n"
"also be enabled from the `Main` class.\n"
"* Introduced a new `camel-catalog-rest` artifact which is a tiny\n"
"standalone REST API of the CamelCatalog using JAX-RS and Swagger\n"
"Annotations.\n"
"* Added `camel-catalog-rest-app` as a standalone application which used\n"
"Apache CXF with Jetty to host the Catalog REST API with embedded Swagger\n"
"UI\n"
"* Returning `null` from Bean should work similar to\n"
"how `setBody` and `transform` works when they set a `null` body.\n"
"* The Camel Spring Boot starter components now have their auto\n"
"configuration depends\n"
"on `org.apache.camel.springboot.CamelAutoConfiguration` which makes it\n"
"easier writing unit tests where you can\n"
"exclude `org.apache.camel.springboot.CamelAutoConfiguration` to turn off\n"
"Camel Spring Boot auto configuration completely.\n"
"* Camel now supports OWASP dependency check maven plugin\n"
"* NATS component now supports TLS and explicit flushing\n"
"(with timeout) of the connection\n"
"* Metrics component\n"
"now supports Gauge type\n"
"* File consumer now supports idempotent-changed and\n"
"idempotent-rename read lock strategies for clustering. \n"
"* Camel Catalog now supports custom runtime providers that only includes\n"
"the supported Camel components, languages and data formats running in\n"
"that container. For example for Karaf or Spring Boot in the\n"
"camel-catalog-provider-karaf and camel-catalog-provider-springboot.\n"
"* The bean\n"
"component will when calling a method that returned an instance of\n"
"`Callable` now call that callable to obtain the chained result. This\n"
"allows to call Groovy functions/closures etc.\n"
"* Failover Load Balancer with\n"
"inheritErrorHandler=false, now allows\n"
"Error Handler to react after the load\n"
"balancer is exhausted.\n"
"* Salesforce component now supports limits, recent\n"
"items, approvals and composite API\n"
"* Dumping Camel routes as XML now includes custom namespaces which are\n"
"at xpath expressions etc. Likewise updating Camel routes from XML can\n"
"now include namespaces which will be associated on xpath expressions.\n"
"* Added `RouteIdFactory` which can auto assign route ids based on the\n"
"consumer endpoints to use more sensitible names, instead of route1,\n"
"route2, etc.\n"
"* Add `skip` function to Simple language\n"
"* Upgraded to Jetty 9.3 (Jetty 9.2 still supported for Karaf 4.0.x\n"
"users)\n"
"* `RouteBuilder` auto-configuration can now be disabled\n"
"from Camel CDI configuration\n"

"* Asynchronous support for CXF JAX-RS producers has\n"
"been added\n"
"* The JSonPath language now supports Map and List\n"
"types and POJOs as well. For POJOs you need to have Jackson on the\n"
"classpath. \n"
"* Data Format which marshal to JSon or XML now\n"
"set the content-type header to application/json or application/xml\n"
"appropriately. \n"
"* The Kafka component can now store offset state\n"
"offline (stateRepository) to preserve this information and be able to\n"
"resume from previous offset.\n"
"* The Kafka component has been improved to be easier to\n"
"configure and use. Notice there is a backwards incompatible change so\n"
"users need to migrate.\n"
"* A topic based idempotent repository that\n"
"is Kafka based for\n"
"the Idempotent Consumer EIP\n"
"* The Kafka component will automatic type convert the\n"
"message body to the type specified by the configured serializer (is\n"
"string by default) when sending to kafka. You can also now configure key\n"
"and partitionKey in the endpoint uri, instead of having to specify as\n"
"headers.\n"
"* The Kafka consumer will now auto commit on stop to\n"
"ensure the broker has the latest offset commit. The\n"
"option `autoCommitOnStop` can be configured to be sync,async or none.\n"

"easily define simple predicates without using the more complex jsonpath\n"
"notation with all the symbols\n"
"* The Box component has been migrated to use the Box v2\n"
"Java API as the old v1 API is going to be shutdown from summer 2017\n"

"inputType and/or outputType.\n"
"There're a few examples demonstrates this feature:\n"
"camel-example-transformer-blueprint, camel-example-transformer-cdi, camel-example-transformer-demo,\n"

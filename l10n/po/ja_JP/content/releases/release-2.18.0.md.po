"* Java DSL with experimental Java8 functional/lambda support. Check out\n"
"the camel-example-java8.\n"
"We love feedback on this DSL and expect to improved the API over the\n"
"next couple of releases.\n"
"* The XSD schema for `<camelContext>` and its other configuration elements\n"
"are now also documented (before it was only `<routes>` and `<rests>`). The\n"
"XSD schema now also documents the default values of all the options.\n"
"* Introduced `FluentProducerTemplate` using fluent builder style as a\n"
"alternative to ProducerTemplate\n"
"* All Camel Components that has options to be\n"
"configured now supports and include Spring\n"
"Boot auto configuration for those options, so they can easily be\n"
"configured in your application.yaml file when using Spring Boot with\n"
"Camel. \n"
"* Camel Spring Boot now supports the\n"
"same link:advanced-configuration-of-camelcontext-using-spring.html[advanced\n"
"configuration] you can do with Spring XML, if the beans have been\n"
"configured using `@Bean` style in a Spring Boot configuration class.\n"
"* Added Hystrix EIP as EIP pattern that uses\n"
"native Netflixx Hystrix as the Circuit Breaker implementation. This\n"
"requires having `camel-hystrix` on the classpath.\n"
"* Added Service Call EIP as EIP pattern that\n"
"allows to call a remote service in a distributed system, where the\n"
"service is looked up from a service registry of some sorts, such as\n"
"kubernetes, consul, etcd, zookeeper etc.\n"
"* Running Camel with Spring Boot now includes a\n"
"Camel Health Indicator (actuator) if `spring-boot-starter-actuator` is\n"
"on the classpath.\n"
"* The Rest component allows to call REST services now\n"
"(as a client), where you can pick one of the following Camel components\n"
"for the HTTP transport: http, http4, netty4-http, jetty, restlet,\n"
"undertow. You can also refer to a existing swagger api doc and include\n"
"camel-swagger-java on the classpath, for automatic validation of rest\n"
"endpoint is configured to use a valid rest operation/parameters.\n"
"* The Rest DSL now auto discovers which HTTP component to use if no\n"
"explicit component name has been configured, by the available components\n"
"on the classpath (by their default name) and if there only exists one,\n"
"then that is used.\n"
"* Spring-DM for OSGi moved out of camel-spring into a separate\n"
"camel-spring-dm module. \n"
"* Improved the Bean component to better match method\n"
"parameter types when using Simple language as\n"
"parameter values.\n"
"* Added `BindyConverter` that allows to implement custom data converters\n"
"for Bindy\n"
"* The access in the Rest DSL has been deprecated and\n"
"no longer in use - its not part of swagger specification anymore.\n"
"* Camel-NATS now uses JNATS client instead of the\n"
"deprecated Java_nats one.\n"
"* During startup of link:../camelcontext.adoc[CamelContext] the services\n"
"that are used as part of routes are now deferred being started to the\n"
"end of the startup process. Some IoC frameworks like Spring can\n"
"otherwise causes a circular dependency issue if services are started too\n"
"early. A side effect is that if service startup failures happen when\n"
"being started later, they are now wrapped in the\n"
"`FailedToStartupRouteException` to better pin point which route thas the\n"
"problem.\n"
"* Improved the startup sequence of Spring\n"
"Java Config to be similar to Spring Boot that\n"
"helps prevent Spring initialization errors about circular dependencies\n"
"issues.\n"
"* Added PATCH to Rest DSL\n"
"* Added \"starts with\" and \"ends with\" operator to the\n"
"Simple language.\n"
"* Added `BeanIOSplitter` to BeanIO that can be used\n"
"with the Splitter EIP to split big payloads in\n"
"streaming mode without reading the entire content into memory.\n"
"* Some of the AWS components allows to specify ARN in the\n"
"endpoint configuration. \n"
"* The create operation in Zookeeper now creates sub\n"
"paths if missing.\n"
"* Added support for async mode for SERVLET component\n"
"to leverage Asynchronous Servlet from the Servlet 3.0 spec.\n"
"* Bean component and Bean\n"
"Language validates method name must be a valid according to java\n"
"identifier rules, and also if parameter syntax has an ending\n"
"parenthesis.\n"
"* You can now use `@RunWith(CamelSpringBootJUnit4ClassRunner.class)` to\n"
"test Camel Spring Boot applications and use the\n"
"Camel test annotations from Spring Testing\n"
"such as `@MockEndpoints`.\n"

"can configure this easily on the CamelContext level\n"
"with `setLogExhaustedMessageBody`\n"
"* Camel-Infinispan now supports Aggregation\n"
"Repository: InfinispanLocalAggregationRepository and\n"
"InfinispanRemoteAggregationRepository\n"
"* The SQL Component and\n"
"ElSql now supports `outputType=StreamList` to use an\n"
"iterator for the output of the SQL query that allows to process the data\n"
"in a streaming fashion such as with the Splitter EIP\n"
"to process the data row by row, and load data from the database as\n"
"needed.\n"
"* JPA now includes a `JpaPollingConsumer` implementation\n"
"that better supports Content Enricher\n"
"using `pollEnrich` to do a on-demand poll that returns either none, one\n"
"or a list of entities as the result. \n"
"* Calling Bean with method parameters defined\n"
"using Simple language parameters, now avoids an intermediate\n"
"conversion of the parameters to a String value. This ensures the passed\n"
"in values when calling the bean method is using the parameter type as-is\n"
"from Simple language.\n"
"* Camel CDI now supports importing Camel XML\n"
"configuration files\n"
"* Camel CDI does not deploy an empty Camel context bean\n"
"anymore if not route builder beans nor Camel beans are deployed\n"
"* Camel CDI adds the `@Named` qualifier to Camel route\n"
"management events so that it's possible to observe these events for a\n"
"specific route with an explicit `id`\n"
"* Camel BeanIO now supports the possibility to use a\n"
"custom BeanReaderErrorHandler implementation in his configuration\n"
"* Camel Kubernetes now supports Kubernetes\n"
"ConfigMap feature\n"
"* The Tokenizer\n"

"to File2 so filtering can be done\n"
"using Simple language or predicates. \n"
"* Optimize Camel to only enable AllowUseOriginalMessage if in use by\n"
"error handler or OnCompletion. End user who\n"
"manually access the original message using the Java API must\n"
"configure AllowUseOriginalMessage=true.\n"
"* Camel-AHC\n"
"Camel-HTTP Camel-HTTP4 Camel-Jetty now\n"
"support a connectionClose parameter to allow explicitly adding a\n"
"Connection Close header to HTTP request\n"
"* Bindy allows to plugin custom formatters for mapping\n"
"to custom types.\n"
"* Content Enricher using `pollEnrich` now\n"
"supports consumers configured with `consumer.bridgeErrorHandler=true` to\n"
"let any exceptions from the poll propagate to the route error handler,\n"
"to let it be able to perform redeliveries and whatnot.\n"
"* CXF and CXFRS now support setting of\n"
"the SSL-context link:camel-configuration-utilities.html[Using the JSSE\n"
"Configuration Utility]\n"

"* The XML DSL will preserve double spaces in the context-path of uri\n"
"attributes when removing white space noise, when uri's are configured\n"
"using mutli lines.\n"

"used when querying the catalog. There is a `camel-catalog-maven` module\n"
"that is able to download catalog JARs from Maven central.\n"
"* A new Camel Attachment interface was added that allows propagating\n"
"headers for attachments. Camel CXF, Camel\n"

"format), and Camel-Jetty set and consume attachment\n"
"headers.\n"
"* Improved bean method call to validate if method name\n"
"with parameters has valid number of parenthesis in the syntax.\n"
"* The JSonPath now supports\n"
"inlined Simple language expressions to allow more\n"
"dynamic expressions.\n"
"* Improved Netty4 producer to be fully asynchronous when connecting to\n"
"remote server.\n"

"* Fixed Bean component to avoid ambiguous error for\n"
"classes that extends generic interface and calling which could lead to\n"
"falsely duplicate methods (due Java type erasure inserts bridge\n"
"methods) \n"
"* Fixed splitting using tarfile could cause OOME if splitting big files\n"
"which was mistakenly loaded into memory. Now we work on the tar stream\n"
"directly.\n"

"placeholders in Rest DSL could cause invalid\n"
"parameters to be included that was from the placeholder.\n"
"* The `threads` EIP now lets Error\n"
"handling in Camel perform redeliveries if the thread pool would\n"
"otherwise reject accepting the task. This allows the error handler to\n"
"perform redeliveries to attempt to put the task on the thread pool\n"
"queue, or eventually move the message to a dead letter queue etc.\n"
"* Fixed Rest DSL adding empty header if specifying a\n"
"non required query parameter that has no default value assigned.\n"

"when using `continued(true)` by default.\n"
"* Fixed so using shareUnitOfWork would now also call\n"
"specialized `AggregationStrategy` for onTimeout, onCompletion etc.\n"
"* Fixed Jetty consumer incorrectly handle\n"
"multipart/form data not being mapped as attachments on the Camel\n"
"Message.\n"

"files when using OSGi.\n"
"* Fixed a potential dead-lock when doing request/reply\n"
"over JMS and requests are timing out concurrently and\n"

msgid "_[Apache Camel Developer's Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/apache-camel-developers-cookbook/book)_ is a collection of over 100 how-to recipes for working with Apache Camel. It is intended for use by busy developers who may not necessarily have time to learn the whole framework in order to be productive. It does this without sacrificing any of the detail needed to build performant, reliable system integrations. Developers new to Apache Camel will find useful information on how to set up Camel in both regular Java and Spring-based applications, through to the ins-and-outs of the various Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) (how they are affected by multithreading, transactions etc.), payload transformations and testing. Experienced developers will also benefit from coverage of parallel and asynchronous processing, error handling and compensation, transactions and idempotency, monitoring and debugging, as well as Camel’s support for security. All recipes are backed by fully unit-tested example code in both the Java and XML DSLs, all of which is available on github at [CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples](http://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples).\n"

Leverage the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) supported by Camel and implement them in your routes. You will then see how components and endpoints handle exchanges in Camel, and how you can use them to create a complete and powerful mediation framework. You will finally learn how to tackle errors and perform testing to ensure that your integration projects are working successfully.\n"

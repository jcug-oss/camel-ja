      <title>Upcoming changes to the consumer on Kafka component</title>

      <description>We recently started to review, investigate and fix reliability issues with the Kafka component. As part of that, we refactored the code to avoid problematic concurrency patterns, remove calls to deprecated Kafka client code and simplify the overall maintainability of the code. This led to many changes in the internal implementation of the component, which we will talk about in this blog post.
Motivation The ground work related to these changes can be traced back to the following set of issues reported on our Jira.</description>

      <description>All Camel projects will drop support for Java 8 by end of 2021.
The next LTS release Camel 3.14, scheduled for December 2021, will be the last release to support Java 8.
In light of this we will extend the support period of Camel 3.14 from 1 year to 2 years. This means Camel 3.14 will reach its end of life (EOL) at end of December 2023.</description>

      <description>Camel K version 1.5 is out. And with it, a new way of providing configuration and resources to your Integration. We have worked on a deep code refactoring in order to harmonize the existing configuration settings and add new ones to exploit the power of camel-quarkus runtime, which has become the main way to materialize an Integration.
We added new features that will simplify your developer life. We also added new checks that will give you useful tips when using a feature in a wrong way.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/05/CamelWebinar/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday Claus Ibsen presented a webinar where he covered all the latest innovations with Apache Camel with focus on Camel Quarkus, Camel K, and Kamelets. This trio is a powerful combination that takes Camel to another level, which allows non developers and IT professionals, to manage and bind systems together without any Camel knowledge.
Kamelets being the Apache Camel solution for an app store experience with integration software.
The webinar is online on youtube and the slides is here.</description>

      <description>Kamelets (Kamel route snippets) are a new concept introduced in Camel K that allow users to connect to external systems via a simplified interface, hiding all the low level details about how those connections are implemented. There are several ways to consume them. One of them is as standard Camel Components. In this case, completion is provided to fill the template id and the parameter names. It is currently based on a fixed set of Kamelets provided by a snapshot of the kamelet catalog.</description>

      <description>Camel K is providing a new feature to Java debug deployed integrations. Before VS Code Tooling for Apache Camel K 0.0.25, more complex steps were required to leverage the VS Code Java debugging capabilities as explained in this previous blogpost.
I recorded a video which is following the steps in this blogpost.

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/05/plantuml-diagram/</guid>
      <description>Hello Camel riders!
I created a tool which allows to draw a PlantUML activity diagram from a running Camel context (not at design time).
The above image shows what kind of diagram you can expect.
I find it useful when I need to have a overall view of interactions between all the routes and endpoints, or to have a visual representation for better understanding and documentation.
You can find all the details on the public GitHub repository.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/05/multicast-failure-routing/</guid>
      <description>Problem description Multicast is a powerful EIP which supports parallel execution paths in asynchronous manner. There are various ways a Camel user can configure a multicast EIP. Check out the extensive documentation here 1. One can configure to execute all the child paths independently and continue routing the last reply as the outgoing message (default behavior unless you provide an aggregation strategy) 2. Additionally, you can plug in an implementation of a Camel aggregation strategy with user-defined logic to aggregate the output from each of those child paths before continuing further downstream routing.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/02/Kamelet-Catalog/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re starting a new initiative at Apache Camel to create a community-driven catalog of reusable Kamelets (Camel route snippets, i.e. connectors) that can be used to stream data from/to external systems into any platform powered by Apache Camel.
The &amp;ldquo;Apache Camel Kamelet catalog&amp;rdquo; is available here and it already contains a collection of useful Kamelets: we would like to extend it with help of the community.
Kamelets are currently supported out-of-the-box by the Apache Camel K project and we&amp;rsquo;re working to support them also in Camel core, so that they can run eventually in any Apache Camel subproject, like Camel Kafka Connector (but also camel-quarkus, camel-spring-boot, &amp;hellip;).</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m introducing a Quarkus feature that plays nice with Camel in order to mock beans for test purpose.
Camel and Quarkus together for mocking beans It&amp;rsquo;s long known that Camel offers great support for Java beans.</description>

 Introduction of marshalling and unmarshalling support on both sink and source connectors
 Upgrade to the latest Apache Camel release 3.4.2
 Addition of new examples in the camel-kafka-connector-examples repository

      <description>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.4.2, a new patch release for the 3.4 LTS version with 6 new features, improvements and fixes.
The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in this Github issue. Although we already have a fix for this problem (see CAMEL-15309), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems.</description>

      <description>Camel and Camel Quarkus are typically used to create integration applications that run as long living processes, a.k.a. daemons or services. In this blog post, we are going to explain a slightly different use case: using Camel Quarkus in programs that exit by themselves after performing some desired tasks.
Where can this be useful? The enterprise is full of scheduled batch processing. Say, some system exports some sort of reports daily at 4 a.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/05/CdcWithCamelAndDebezium/</guid>
      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) is a well-established software design pattern for a system that monitors and captures data changes, so that other software can respond to those events.
Using a CDC engine like Debezium along with [Camel]() integration framework, we can easily build data pipelines to bridge traditional data stores and new cloud-native event-driven architectures.
The advantages of CDC comparing to a simple poll-based or query-based process are:
 All changes captured: intermediary changes (updates, deletes) between two runs of the poll loop may be missed.</description>

Then comparing the memory usage of running the example in JVM mode vs native compiled with GraalVM. Then showing for the finale how to quickly run 100 instances of the example each on their own TCP port and how quick Camel are to startup and service the first requests faster than you can type and click.</description>

      <description>The Apache Camel project is moving to release schedule with Long Term Support (LTS) and non-LTS releases.
The plan is to have 2 yearly LTS releases and then non-LTS releases in between.
This allows the Camel project to innovate and move much faster in non-LTS releases.
And as well to offer production stable branches (LTS) where end users can stay on for a longer period of time and get CVEs and important/critical bug fixes only.</description>

The call for presentations for ApacheCon North America 2020 is now open and the wider Camel community members are encouraged to submit. Look for the Camel/Integration track when submitting.
We&amp;rsquo;re most interested to see talks that offer a learning experience to the attendees, so talks that present new parts of the Camel ecosystem (Camel K, Camel Quarkus, Camel Kafka Connector), talks showing off lessons learned, use cases, and visions on where software integration is heading in the future.</description>

      <description>Have you built a new great Web API for your product? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wonderful to have it available as a part of the great Apache Camel component family? We would love it.
The community just released Camel 3 which is more modular, lightweight and already includes lots of components (300+) to quickly integrate various systems consuming or producing data. All of these components can be used with the same integration domain specific language (DSL) based on the famous Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the European Commission for the last 4 years as a Software Architect, working for a unit responsible for developing reusable components, and advocating open source software. In this context, we organized already a couple of Hackathons and Bug bounties open to all the open source communities.
In the team, we worked already a couple of times with Apache Camel, and I like the elegance and performance compared with other integration frameworks.</description>

      <description>The Apache Camel community introduces a new subproject in the ecosystem: Camel-Kafka-Connector. This project born as a PoC exploring the possibility of leveraging the Apache Camel components as Kafka source and sink connectors. The main idea behind the project is reusing the Camel Components&amp;rsquo; flexibility in a simple way, through a configuration file mixing Kafka Connect configuration and Camel route definitions and options.
What is Kafka Connect? It is an Apache Kafka&amp;rsquo;s framework that defines a standardized way to stream data in and out a kafka broker.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 2.18.0 release which resolved over 500 issues. This is first release that requires Java 8 and comes with a much-improved Spring Boot support, and ships with numerous new features, improvements and bug fixes.
 Java DSL with experimental Java8 functional/lambda support. Check out the camel-example-java8. We love feedback on this DSL and expect to improved the API over the next couple of releases. The XSD schema for &amp;lt;camelContext&amp;gt; and its other configuration elements are now also documented (before it was only &amp;lt;routes&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;rests&amp;gt;).</description>

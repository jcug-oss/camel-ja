      <description>Kamelets (Kamel route snippets) are a new concept introduced in Camel K that allow users to connect to external systems via a simplified interface, hiding all the low level details about how those connections are implemented. There are several ways to consume them. One of them is as standard Camel Components. In this case, completion is provided to fill the template id and the parameter names. It is currently based on a fixed set of Kamelets provided by a snapshot of the kamelet catalog.</description>

      <description>Hello Camel riders!
I created a tool which allows to draw a PlantUML activity diagram from a running Camel context (not at design time).
The above image shows what kind of diagram you can expect.
I find it useful when I need to have a overall view of interactions between all the routes and endpoints, or to have a visual representation for better understanding and documentation.
You can find all the details on the public GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>Camel K version 1.5 is out. And with it, a new way of providing configuration and resources to your Integration. We have worked on a deep code refactoring in order to harmonize the existing configuration settings and add new ones to exploit the power of camel-quarkus runtime, which has become the main way to materialize an Integration.
We added new features that will simplify your developer life. We also added new checks that will give you useful tips when using a feature in a wrong way.</description>

      <description>Kamelets (Kamel route snippets) are a new concept introduced in Camel K that allow users to connect to external systems via a simplified interface, hiding all the low level details about how those connections are implemented. There are several ways to consume them. One of them is as standard Camel Components. In this case, completion is provided to fill the template id and the parameter names. It is currently based on a fixed set of Kamelets provided by a snapshot of the kamelet catalog.</description>

      <description>Camel K is providing a new feature to Java debug deployed integrations. Before VS Code Tooling for Apache Camel K 0.0.25, more complex steps were required to leverage the VS Code Java debugging capabilities as explained in this previous blogpost.

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/02/Kamelet-Catalog/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re starting a new initiative at Apache Camel to create a community-driven catalog of reusable Kamelets (Camel route snippets, i.e. connectors) that can be used to stream data from/to external systems into any platform powered by Apache Camel.
The &amp;ldquo;Apache Camel Kamelet catalog&amp;rdquo; is available here and it already contains a collection of useful Kamelets: we would like to extend it with help of the community.
Kamelets are currently supported out-of-the-box by the Apache Camel K project and we&amp;rsquo;re working to support them also in Camel core, so that they can run eventually in any Apache Camel subproject, like Camel Kafka Connector (but also camel-quarkus, camel-spring-boot, &amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>Apache Camel K 1.2.0 has been released!
This version introduces some important features that will play an increasingly bigger role in future releases of Camel K.
Quarkus as default runtime Camel K 1.2.0 uses camel-quarkus 1.1.0 (Quarkus 1.8.0.Final) as runtime, but Quarkus is no longer an optional runtime for Camel K: Quarkus is now the default runtime.
This means that users no longer need to enable Quarkus explicitly when running their integrations (using kamel run -t quarkus.</description>

This post contains a list of cool stuff that you&amp;rsquo;ll find in the 1.0 GA release.
First of all, if you&amp;rsquo;re living under a rock and it&amp;rsquo;s the first time you hear about Camel K, you can read some introductory blog posts here (1 - introducing camel k, 2 - camel k on knative) or look at the Apache Camel website that contains a Camel K section with a lot of material that is automatically generated from the Github repository.</description>

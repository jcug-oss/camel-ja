    <p>Apache Camel 3.5 has just been released.
This is a non-LTS release which means we will not provide patch releases, but use the release as-is. The next planned LTS release is 3.7 scheduled towards end of the year.
So what&rsquo;s in this release? This release introduces new set of features and noticeable improvements that will we cover in this blog post.
Java 14 This is the first release that supports Java 14.</p>

    <p>We recently released camel-kafka-connector 0.4.0. This is the first release of the latest project in the Camel’s ecosystem, based on an LTS camel release.
 The main features of this release are:
 Introduction of aggregation support
 Introduction of marshalling and unmarshalling support on both sink and source connectors
 Upgrade to the latest Apache Camel release 3.4.2
 Addition of new examples in the camel-kafka-connector-examples repository
 Integration tests added for HDFS (sink), Cassandra/CQL (source), Slack (Source), JDBC (sink) and MongoDB (sink/source).</p>

    <p>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.4.2, a new patch release for the 3.4 LTS version with 6 new features, improvements and fixes.
The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in this Github issue. Although we already have a fix for this problem (see CAMEL-15309), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems.</p>

    <p>Apache Camel K has made a lot of progress since its inception and we&rsquo;re now proud to announce the 1.0 release. We&rsquo;ve been working hard in the past months to add more awesome features to Camel K, but also to improve stability and performance. This post contains a list of cool stuff that you&rsquo;ll find in the 1.0 GA release.
First of all, if you&rsquo;re living under a rock and it&rsquo;s the first time you hear about Camel K, you can read some introductory blog posts here (1 - introducing camel k, 2 - camel k on knative) or look at the Apache Camel website that contains a Camel K section with a lot of material that is automatically generated from the Github repository.</p>

    <p>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.1.0, a new minor release with over 291 new features, improvements and fixes.
All users of Camel 3.0 are encouraged to upgrade to Camel 3.1 soon because there are some major memory usage optimizations in this release. We also plan to retire Camel 3.0 very soon due to this. Please read our Camel 3.x upgrade guide that describes how to upgrade Camel 3.</p>

    <p>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</p>
